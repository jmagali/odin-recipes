        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This no-bake ice cream cake is a crowd-pleasing dessert that layers classic ice cream sandwiches with rich hot fudge, gooey caramel, and fluffy whipped topping. Sweet, creamy, and crunchy with a touch of nutty pecan, it's the kind of treat that disappears fast and leaves everyone asking for seconds.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly grease or line a 9x13-inch dish for easy removal. Arrange half of the ice cream sandwiches in a flat layer across the bottom, trimming them as needed to fit snugly and cover the base completely.</li>
            <li>Spread a generous layer of thawed whipped topping over the sandwiches, using a spatula to smooth it out. Drizzle warm hot fudge and caramel sauces evenly across the whipped topping, allowing them to gently swirl together but not fully mix.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with a second layer of ice cream sandwiches directly on top of the first, aligning them neatly. Follow with another layer of whipped topping and an additional drizzle of both sauces, ending with a final, smooth coat of whipped topping to cover the entire surface.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle chopped pecans over the top for added crunch and a hint of nuttiness. For extra flair, you can add sprinkles, chocolate shavings, or cherries if desired.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and place it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, or until the cake is firm and easy to slice. Serve cold and enjoy as-is or with your favorite sundae toppings.</li>
        </ol>
