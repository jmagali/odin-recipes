        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs chicken</li>
            <li>3 pieces dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon whole peppercorn</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly season the chicken with salt and heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, place the chicken pieces skin side down and sear them until the skin turns golden brown. Flip and sear the other side as well. This step helps develop flavor and gives the chicken a slightly crisp texture on the outside while keeping the inside juicy.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a plate and lower the heat to medium. In the same pot, add the crushed garlic and saut√© it gently in the remaining oil. Stir constantly to prevent burning and cook until the garlic becomes aromatic and lightly browned, releasing its full flavor into the oil.</li>
            <li>Return the seared chicken to the pot, arranging it evenly over the garlic. Pour in the soy sauce, white vinegar, and water, making sure the chicken is mostly submerged. Add the bay leaves and whole peppercorns at this stage. Let the mixture come to a boil without stirring so the vinegar has time to mellow. Boiling it undisturbed allows the acid in the vinegar to cook off slightly, reducing its sharpness and balancing the flavor.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture reaches a steady boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the chicken simmer gently for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the meat is tender and cooked through. The sauce will slowly reduce and thicken, absorbing into the chicken while also intensifying in flavor. Stir occasionally toward the end to prevent sticking and to ensure the sauce coats the chicken evenly.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in the sugar to round out the saltiness and acidity with a hint of sweetness. Taste the sauce and add more salt only if necessary, as the soy sauce may already provide enough seasoning. Serve the chicken hot with a generous spoonful of sauce and enjoy it alongside freshly cooked white rice.</li>
