        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until browned and crumbly, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking. Once no longer pink, drain any excess grease, then return the pan to the heat.</li>
            <li>Add the taco seasoning and water to the cooked beef. Stir thoroughly to coat the meat in the seasoning mixture and simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated, creating a richly spiced and slightly saucy filling.</li>
            <li>While the beef simmers, prepare the salad base by combining chopped romaine lettuce, drained kidney beans, halved grape tomatoes, sliced avocado, chopped carrots, green bell pepper, celery, and shredded Cheddar cheese in a large mixing bowl. Toss gently to distribute the ingredients evenly, or keep certain items on the side for picky eaters.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, make the dressing by whisking together lime juice, honey, champagne vinegar, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, chopped cilantro, salt, and black pepper. Mix until smooth and well blended.</li>
            <li>Spoon the seasoned beef over the salad just before serving, and drizzle the dressing on top or serve it alongside. Pair with tortilla chips or taco shells for added crunch and fun, especially for younger eaters who prefer to build their own tacos.</li>
